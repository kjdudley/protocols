# Protocol for carrying out agarose gel electrophoresis of genomic DNA

## Gel preparation

+ Prepare 1% agarose in 1x TBE buffer using a pyrex glass conical flask:
  + 1 g agarose (or 0.5 g agarose)
  + 100 ml 1x TBE (or 50 ml 1x TBE if using 0.5 g agarose)
+ Microwave on full power for 1 minute, swirl, and microwave for an additional 30 seconds if crystals still present.
+ When agarose has completely dissolved allow solution to cool to a temperature that is comfortable to hold (~40 C) before adding gel red (5 % v/v; 5 ul in 100 ml).
+ Swirl solution to mix and then pour into a precast tray with the desired comb attached (e.g. 15 well comb).
+ When the gel has set remove the comb and transfer to an appropriately sized electrophoresis tank filled with 1x TBE buffer (so that the gel is completely submerged).
+ Ensure that the gel has been placed in the correct orientation so that the wells are closest to the positive electrode.

## Sample preparation, loading and electrophoresis

+ Prepare each sample as follows:
  + Genomic DNA 30 ng (1-5 ul)
  + 6x loading buffer (1 ul)
  + Nuclease free water (up to 6 ul)
+ Load 2 ul of 1 Kb ladder into desired wells.
+ Load 6 ul samples into desired wells.
+ Connect electrodes to the gel tank and apply 90 V for 45 minutes.
+ Observe gel under UV light using a gel documentation system.
+ If necessary, carry out additional electrophoresis and repeat the gel imaging step.
