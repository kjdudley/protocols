# P015A Protocol for Adaptor Preparation version A

Combine the two oligonucelotides for each adaptor and hold the tubes at room temperature for 5 mins.

e.g. for Adaptor-1:

Ada-1a (5 uM)           25ul

Ada-b (5 uM)            25ul
----------------------------------
                        50ul

These can be used directly.

*Note: The final concentration of the adaptors is 2.5 uM!*
