# P015B Protocol for Adaptor Preparation version B

Combine the two oligonucelotides for each adaptor and hold the tubes at 95 C for 5mins, then let the mix cool down slowly.

e.g. for Adaptor-1:

Ada-1a (5 uM)            20ul

Ada-b (5 uM)             20ul
----------------------------------
                         40ul

These can be used directly.

*Note: The final concentration of the adaptors is 2.5 uM!*
