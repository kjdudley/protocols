# P015C Protocol for Adaptor Preparation version C

Combine the two oligonucelotides for each adaptor and hold the tubes at 95 C for 5mins, then let the mix cool down slowly.

e.g. for Adaptor-1:

Ada-1a (10 uM)           20ul

Ada-b (10 uM)            20ul
----------------------------------
                         40ul

These can be used directly.

*Note: The final concentration of the adaptors is 5 uM (as described in the Methyl-RAD publication).*
