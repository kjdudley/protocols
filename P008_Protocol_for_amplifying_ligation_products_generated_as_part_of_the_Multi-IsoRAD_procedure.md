P008 Protocol for amplifying ligation products generated as part of the Multi-IsoRAD procedure

Ligation products are amplified in 50 µl reactions containing 18 µl ligated DNA, 0.16 µM of each primer (A and B), 0.25 mM dNTP, 1x Phusion HF buffer and 0.8 U Phusion high-fidelity DNA polymerase (NEB).

Prepare master mix using volumes outlined below (per reaction):

5x HF buffer  10 ul
10 mM dNTP	1.2 ul
Phusion high-fidelity DNA polymerase (2 U/μl)	0.4 ul
10 uM primer A  0.8 ul
10 uM primer B  0.8 ul
Nuclease free water	18.8 ul
Total	32

PCR cycling conditions:

Denaturation: 98°C for 5 s
Cycling: 16–22 cycles of 98°C for 5 s, 60°C for 20 s, 72°C for 10 s
Final Extension: 72°C for 5 min
