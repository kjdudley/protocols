P004 Protocol for generating 32 bp fragments from modified CpG sites in genomic DNA using BsaXI
(based on Multi-IsoRAD Protocol)

Set up the following reaction in a sterile microcentrifuge tube (add BsaXI last):

For each sample, prepare 14 μl of BsaXI master mix as follows:

10X CutSmart Buffer	1.5 μl
BsaXI	0.5 μl (2 units)
Nuclease-free water	to 14 μl

Add 1 μl of genomic DNA (0.2 ug). Incubate the samples at 37 °C for 45 min.

Set up a digestion control (i.e. without the addition of BsaXI).
