# P007 Protocol for amplifying ligation products generated as part of the Methyl-RAD procedure

Ligation products are amplified in 20 ul reactions containing 7 ul ligated DNA, 0.2 uM of each primer (p1 and p2), 0.3 mM dNTP, 1x Phusion HF buffer and 0.4 U Phusion high-fidelity DNA polymerase (NEB).

Prepare master mix using volumes outlined below (per reaction):

+ 5x HF Buffer  4 ul
+ 10 mM dNTP  0.6 ul
+ Phusion HF DNA polymerase (2 U/ul)  0.2 ul
+ 10 uM P1 Primer 0.4 ul
+ 10 uM P2 Primer 0.4 ul
+ Nuclease free water 8 ul
+ Total 13 ul

PCR cycling conditions:

+ Denaturation: 98 C for 30 s
+ Cycling: 16â€“22 cycles of 98 C for 5 s, 60 C for 20 s, 72 C for 10 s
+ Final Extension: 72 C for 5 min
