# Modified Protocol for Methylation of Genomic DNA

## Protocol

Dilute SAM to 1600 uM using the supplied 32 mM stock.

+ SAM 32 mM stock 1 ul
+ Nuclease free water 19 ul

Add in order:

+ Nuclease free water 14 ul
+ 10x Cutsmart buffer 2 ul
+ Diluted SAM from step 1 2 ul
+ Genomic DNA (1 ug) 1 ul
+ M.SssI methylase (4 U/ul) 1 ul

Mix, Pipette up and down at least six times.
Incubate two hours at 37 C.
Stop the reaction by heating at 65 C for 20 minutes.

Notes:

1. The volume of DNA can be increased to 5 ul. When using more dilute DNA increase the reaction volume to 50 ul. Using too much DNA volume in the reaction can cause inhibition by changing the pH or salt concentration of the reaction.
2. Up to 4 ug of DNA can be methylated in a 20 Î¼l reaction. The SAM concentration should be adjusted to 640 uM. Concentrated SssI M0226M (1 ul of 20,000 U/ml) should be used.
3. The incubation time can be increased to 4 hours. Overnight incubations do not give significant increases in methylation.
4. The above protocol can also be used for other types of DNA including plasmids and purified PCR products.

Example of a large-scale methylation:

1. Add in order:
+ Nuclease free water 220 ul
+ 10X NEBuffer 2 50 ul
+ SAM 32 mM 10 ul
+ Lambda DNA (500 ug/ml) 200 ul
+ SssI methylase (20 U/ul) 20 ul
2. Mix, Pipette up and down at least six times.
3. Incubate 2 hours at 37 C.
4. Stop the reaction by heating at 65 C for 20 minutes. The DNA can be purified by phenol extraction followed by ethanol precipitation or by using a commercial DNA purification kit. For long-term storage at -20 C, suspend in TE.
