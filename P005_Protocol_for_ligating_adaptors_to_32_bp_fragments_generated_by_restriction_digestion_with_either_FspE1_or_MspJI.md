# P005 Protocol for ligating adaptors to 32 bp fragments generated by restriction digestion with either FspE1 or MspJI

Set up the following reaction in a microcentrifuge tube on ice. T4 DNA Ligase should be added last. Gently mix the reaction by pipetting up and down and microfuge briefly.

Prepare ligation master mix containing 0.1 uM each of two adaptors, 1 mM ATP and 800 U of T4 DNA ligase (NEB) per reaction:

+ 10x T4 ligase buffer      1 ul
+ 10 mM ATP                 1 ul
+ T4 DNA ligase (400 U/ul)  2 ul
+ Nuclease free water       5.2 ul
+ Adaptor A                 0.4 ul (of 2.5 uM stock)
+ Adaptor B                 0.4 ul (of 2.5 uM stock)
+ Total                     10 ul

Add 10 ul master mix to 10 ul of the digestion solution, and incubate for 16 h at 4 C.

*Note: The T4 DNA Ligase Buffer should be thawed and resuspended at room temperature.*

*Note: Final concentration of each adaptor is 0.1 uM!*
